This week I relearned graph theory, Dijkstra's algorthm, and some basic OOP
principles with C++. This was a great project to learn these concepts and 
I feel comfortable using classes in C++ now. This was my first time using 
the 'new' keyword for heap allocations in C++. The new syntax was 
unfamiliar but easy to pick up. I also learned about C++ constructors and 
destructors. OOP makes it simpler to program and think about concepts that
tie data and methods together. It was nice to use when creating a graph 
data structure. I chose to use an adjacency matrix for this graph 
implementation because it is simpler to visiualize that a list. For large 
amounts of nodes, my implementation could be problematic from a memory 
usage standpoint. The wikipedia page and geeksforgeeks references for 
Dijkstra's algorithm were great aids in implementing it. After this project 
I feel more confortable using C++'s OOP features. This was my first time 
writing a Monte Carlo simulation but it was straightforward to do so. I 
used my Graph::display() method on small number of nodes to debug my code.
This was very helpful and I would suggest that to other students.
